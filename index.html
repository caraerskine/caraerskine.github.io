    <h1>Cara Erskine</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am an architect archetype. I have worn many 
      hats: art professor, electrician, and now full-stack software engineer. I have found my professional home in 
      software engineering; it combines all of my artistic and technical skills into a dynamic, 
      moldable, scalable platform where I can thrive with my growth-mindset. 
      I am an object-oriented programmer: I love the simplicity and beauty of Ruby, the power of Rails, the flow of the 
      HTTP request-response cycle, the nimble components of React. My career path shows that I 
      am a lifelong learner. I am currently learning Python to add to my stack of of Rails, Ruby, 
      JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Git/GitHub and REST APIs.
      
      <br><br> Outside of coding, I spend most of my time 
      making art. I am a lifelong athlete, I do CrossFit and enjoy playing basketball and golf. I 
      also love traveling and want to see more of the world.
